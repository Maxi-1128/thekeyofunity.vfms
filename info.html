      <h2>About the Play</h2>
      <p>
        In Harry's time at Hogwarts, Hogwarts faces a challenge unlike any before.
        The Founders' ancient artifact, the Key of Unity, has re-emerged — and its secrets may
        decide the fate of the school. This original stage production brings together mystery,
        magic, and the spirit of house unity, featuring beloved characters and thrilling
        new challenges.

  <h2>Storyline</h2>
  <p>
    At Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, an extraordinary discovery shatters the routine of the school year — a mysterious key, forged by the four Founders themselves, has been found. Legend whispers that it can unlock a hidden stone containing magic powerful enough to unite all four houses… or tear them apart forever. As whispers spread through the corridors, tensions rise, and alliances begin to shift.
  </p>
  <p>
    To protect the key from falling into the wrong hands, the professors set a series of magical challenges, each demanding the strengths of Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Students must face their fears, outwit enchanted puzzles, and learn to trust those they once considered rivals. In a race against time, the fate of the school will depend not on magic alone — but on unity.
